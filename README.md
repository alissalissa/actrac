# actrac
 Daily Activity Tracker

 ## Dependencies

 ## Building
 Linux/MacOS:
 	1) Open the bin/Makefile.
	2) Modify the WX_INCLUDE_PATH and WX_LIBS arguments to point to your install of wxWidgets (note: this may be as simple as eliminating the path entirely and just pointing straight to wx-config depending on how you installed wx).
	3) Navigate back to the main directory.
	4) Run make
	5) Run cd bin
	6) Execute ./actrac in order to start the application

Windows:
	1) Switch to linux
	2) See instructions for Linux/MacOS

This project is massively still under development.  No guarentees are made is to the quality of the code or executable, and if you choose to run this code on your system, you do so at your own risk.

## Future Directions
Eventually, I'll figure out how to build this software on Windows.  Feel free to make a PR to update this file if you know how to do it.

This project takes a back seat to my actual life, so while I continue to make steady progress, it might take a while to get to beta quality.
